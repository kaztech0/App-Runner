# App-Runner
Add as many apps as you want for an easy one click start for your morning.


(I have no idea how to import these files into github since there is a ton of files that pycharm creates so if you want to download this program just go to releases)


# Tutorial:
Press open file to open any executable and add it to the list.
Once you are happy with the apps you have opened press 'Run Apps'.
Once you exit the app there will be 'save.txt', it does what you would expect.
If you want to delete your save just delete 'save.txt'.

# Uses:
Say you need to open a bunch of executables like Photoshop and Vegas Pro, this app will nullify that process into one click.
